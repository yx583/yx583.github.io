    Hi, my name is Yiqing (Selina) Xin. Feel free to call me Selina. I am a data-driven problem solver with a passion for analytics and optimization.
    I graduated from University of California, Davis, with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Statistics. I have developed a strong foundation in statistical analysis, data structures, and optimization. 
    I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering, Data Analytics Track, at Cornell University, where I am sharpening my skills in Python, SQL, Exccel, and other analytical tools.
    I have improved my analytical skills through several experiences, including data analysis interns with Tencent and Meituan in Beijing, China, and a data analytics capstone project with Pitney Bowes at Cornell. 
    I have also led several data analytics projects, including a project analyzing auto replacement data that ranked top 3 in the CarMax Data Analytics Showcase Competition.
    My ultimate goal is to use my skills and knowledge to improve business processes and solve complex problems through data-driven decision-making. I am excited to continue developing my skills and exploring new ways to apply data analytics to create meaningful impact.
